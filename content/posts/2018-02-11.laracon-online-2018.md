On the 7th February, I attended not only my first online conference but my first Laravel dedicated conference and simply put - it was amazing.

[Laracon Online 2018](https://laracon.net) featured talks that covered both technical and theoretical topics and were delivered by speakers who possessed complete passion and charisma.

One of my main highlights was [Jonathan Reinink](https://twitter.com/reinink) who delivered a talk about "Advanced Querying with Eloquent" which even now, 6 days later, had me astounded. The talk was given in an easy to digest manner and delivered information I'd never even thought about. I wanted to back and refactor all of my applications instantly. I'll need to rewatch this one so that I can make sure I didn't miss anything.

Another personal favourite was [Steve Schoger](https://twitter.com/steveschoger) who showed how the little considerations and changes with your UI can make a whole world of difference. The talk titled "The Little Details of UI Design" went over taking a design and making minor tweaks to improve the overall UI, flow and absorption of information - amazing stuff. 

Steve also tweets about little tips on a regular basis and I highly recommend you check his [Twitter](https://twitter.com/steveschoger).

Every talk was really well informed and [Ian Landsman](https://twitter.com/ianlandsman) did an outstanding job of putting the whole thing together and delivering it all for a low price of $25. I do recommend heading to the [official site](https://laracon.net) and taking a peek at the videos (plus some digital swag).

It'll be a no-brainer if another Laracon Online event takes place that I'll be getting a ticket instantly.
